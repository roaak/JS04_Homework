/* Write a script that can generate random addresses
As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: street number, street name, city name, state name and zip code
Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
Each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly-generated address to the terminal. For example:
node random-address.js
=> 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506 */
